# tarpaulin
The Final Project for CS493 Cloud Development

## Tests
 * The test files can be found in `/tests`
 * The tests can be ran by importing the collection file `Tarpaulin.postman_collection` and environmental file `Tarpaulin-env.postman_environment` into postman
   * For postman app: `https://www.postman.com/downloads/`
   * For postman in-browser: `https://web.postman.co/home`
  
 * The tests are seperated by their main collections, then further by the user's access level.
  
 * Note: Currently the environment variables will need to be changed to have valid variables once the initial data has been inserted into the database.
